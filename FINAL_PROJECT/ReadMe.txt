NAME:               Gaurav Makin & Anup Kumar

CLASS:              PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYTICS

PROJECT OBJECTIVE:  Analyze weather/temperature data to determine rise in mean annual temperatures for 
                    countries and major cities, tracking how average temperature has changed over the years.
                    To provide a numerical and graphical analysis on global warming (extreme temperatures i.e. hot
                    and cold). 
                    Based on this numerical analysis we will try to extrapolate the temperature in a future period.
